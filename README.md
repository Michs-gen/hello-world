# hello-world

Hey there!

I'm a med student based in Milan. I love research and computer science. 
I've been learning python for 2 years now and I've just started learning R.

Can't to explore GitHub and get inspired by other people's projects. 

My main aim is to practice my coding skills. 

SEE YOU IN A WHILE CROCODILE.
